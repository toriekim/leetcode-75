  ‚≠ê 450. Delete Node in a BST
  https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/

  Tags: Medium, Tree, Binary Search Tree, Binary Search

  Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

  Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:
    1. Search for a node to remove.
    2. If the node is found, delete the node.


  Example 1:
    Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
    Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
    Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
    One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
    Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.

  Example 2:
    Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
    Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
    Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.

  Example 3:
    Input: root = [], key = 0
    Output: []


  Constraints:
    - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
    - -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
    - Each node has a unique value.
    - root is a valid binary search tree.
    - -10^5 <= key <= 10^5

  Follow up: Could you solve it with time complexity O(height of tree)?

    // If the node has no child nodes, simply return null
    if (!root.left && !root.right) return null;

    // If the node has both (left & right), pick one to replace it
